# CurveFitting-code
Standalone version of the curve fitting code from the ImageProcessingGUI.  Made for Nanoplasmonics Laboratory @ IIT Gandhinagar

We are using a python script to use mathematical approximations to fit the power law function by using an external equation as reference. In this specific code, there are two referal codes ( truncated and non truncated equations ). This is achieved by using python functions like curve_fit etc.
